This repository contains two example GitHub actions for Jira automation.  Either of these should be modified to meet specific requirements.

  - [add-comment-to-issue.yml](.github/workflows/add-comment-to-issue.yml)

B. Move issue to Done state when commit message ends with substring `CLOSE ISSUE`

  - [transition-issue.yml](.github/workflows/transition-issue.yml)
